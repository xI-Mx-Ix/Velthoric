# Contributing to Velthoric

Hi there! Thanks for checking out **Velthoric**.

Velthoric is a physics-focused Minecraft project born out of a passion for experimenting with game mechanics and engine-like features. We build this primarily to learn and explore new ideas, but we are always happy to see others use the code, learn from it, or contribute their own improvements.

Since this is a passion project, we develop it at our own pace. We value your contributions highly, but please keep in mind that our own roadmap and vision for the mod will guide what gets merged.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
Found a bug, a crash, or something that just feels "off"?
- **Open a GitHub Issue:** The more details, the better.
- **Be Specific:** Please include steps to reproduce the issue, your environment (Minecraft version + NeoForge/Fabric version), and any logs or screenshots.

Feature suggestions are welcome, too! Just let us know what you have in mind.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
We love seeing PRs that help improve Velthoric. Here is how to make the process smooth for everyone:

1.  **Chat with us first (optional):** For big changes or new features, it’s often a good idea to open an Issue first to discuss your idea. This ensures your work aligns with the project's goals before you start coding.
2.  **Target the correct branch:** Please submit your Pull Request to the branch that corresponds to the Minecraft version you are working on. For example, if you are fixing something for the latest version, target that specific version branch.
3.  **Keep it clean:** Try to keep your code style consistent with the rest of the project.
4.  **Write clear commits:** A short explanation of *what* you changed and *why* helps us review your code much faster.
5.  **Test your changes:** Please make sure your changes work in-game and don't break existing mechanics.

### Code Reviews
We review all contributions before merging. We might ask for small changes or clarifications, so please treat this as a collaboration to make the code the best it can be.

## What to Expect
- **Priorities:** We try to review PRs as fast as we can, but since we do this in our free time, it might take a moment.
- **Selection:** We want Velthoric to stay focused. While we appreciate every effort, we might not merge a PR if it doesn't fit the current direction of the mod.

## Thank You!
Whether you’re fixing a typo, squashing a bug, or adding a cool new physics mechanic, thank you for your time and effort. You help make Velthoric better!

Happy coding!
