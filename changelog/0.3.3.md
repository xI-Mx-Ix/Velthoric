# Changelog – Version 0.3.3

## Features
- Ported mod to Minecraft 1.21.1 (NeoForge & Fabric).
- Implemented unified native loader for Jolt Physics and Zstd.
- Added new physics information panels to the F3 debug menu.
- Implemented utility to generate Jolt convex hulls from render meshes.
- Decoupled debug chart rendering for better visual integration.

## Fixes
- Resolved critical NeoForge crashes related to networking, Gradle, and Mixins.
- Corrected UV mapping in ClothRenderer to fix full atlas rendering.
- Fixed camera orientation and perspective transformations for physics-mounted entities.
- Enforced braking logic when switching between forward and reverse gears.
- Ensured vehicle mounting state persists across server restarts.
- Prevented race condition crashes in VxChunkDataStore during shutdown.
- Resolved terrain system deadlocks during server shutdown.
- Corrected physics chart scaling and alignment with vanilla FPS/TPS graphs.
- Fixed logic to reset physics pause state on world disconnect.

## Performance Improvements
- Overhauled network packet serialization with Zstd compression.
- Replaced UUIDs with integer network IDs for body synchronization to reduce bandwidth.
- Implemented asynchronous region and index saving to prevent server stalls.
- Replaced standard collections with FastUtil to reduce memory overhead.
- Eliminated autoboxing in network dispatcher to reduce Garbage Collection pressure.
- Optimized post-update sync with lock-free passes and multi-locking.
- Prevented blocking chunk loads during buoyancy broadphase calculations.
- Tuned terrain tracker grid cell size for precise clustering.

## Refactors & Architecture
- Reworked networking layer for direct NetworkManager use and unified packet handling.
- Unified buoyancy force calculation with recursive shape processing.
- Bundled all native libraries (vx-native) with consistent paths and loading methods.
- Moved NeoForge entrypoints to a dedicated package structure.

## Chore & Miscellaneous
- Updated Jolt Physics JNI to version 3.5.0.
- Rewrote CONTRIBUTING.md for better clarity.
- Standardized version numbering and build configuration properties.
