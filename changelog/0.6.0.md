# Changelog – Version 0.6.0

## Features

- Implemented extended region file format to remove chunk size limits and enable automatic data pruning
- Added hot-map persistence architecture for instant body registration and lookup
- Introduced persistence flags for physics bodies and constraints
- Implemented Jolt-based modular powertrain system with transmission logic
- Added directional fluid flow vectors for advanced buoyancy simulation
- Added new `VxKeyMapping` system with fallback display names for unbound keys
- Added client-side callbacks for body registration lifecycle events
- Enabled automatic creation and deletion of empty region files
- Added CurseForge environment metadata support

## Fixes

- Fixed multiple persistence race conditions causing missing or empty physics data
- Prevented native crashes by validating body existence before buoyancy locking
- Resolved Linux physics instability by replacing batch locking with sequential access
- Ensured inactive and non-dirty bodies persist correctly during chunk save and shutdown
- Fixed gravity desync in native buoyancy implementation
- Fixed terrain velocity prediction causing excessive chunk loading
- Corrected array bounds during body store reallocation
- Ensured synchronous snapshot creation to prevent data loss on shutdown
- Fixed file locking issues by introducing sequential I/O processor
- Fixed multiple edge cases in async persistence flush logic

## Performance

- Overhauled network dispatcher with chunk-centric broadcasting and raw data streams
- Optimized physics update loop by removing integer autoboxing and map lookups
- Migrated terrain system to zero-allocation SoA snapshots with linear memory access
- Replaced map-based body stores with direct array indexing
- Implemented ThreadLocal pooling for network dispatch and physics updates
- Optimized buoyancy broad-phase using low-allocation flow sampling
- Optimized quaternion slerp by removing per-call object allocations
- Eliminated allocation churn in terrain tracker by reusing collections
- Optimized body state packet serialization to avoid temporary arrays
- Integrated native Jolt buoyancy implementation for near-zero GC overhead
